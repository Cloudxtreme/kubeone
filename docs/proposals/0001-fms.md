# kubeone apply

**Author**: Artiom Diomin (@kron4eg)  
**Status**: Draft proposal

## Motivation and Background
Currently kubeone can only `init` clusters, but `repair` and `upgrades` are
also needed. It's possible to unify them all under one `kubeone apply` command.

## Implementation
In current form we don't consider any instance state at all and just proceed to
install whatever we need and rely on the fact that apt-get/yum/kubeadm are
idempotent. That strategy makes it impossible to implement repair/upgrades.

So we need to **probe** (reconcile) actual state of the cluster instances before
making any decisions.

Putting together **state** and **state transitions** produced by different
**probes** we arrive to the **Finite State Machine** (FSM) computation model,
that will help us to choose what to do with a cluster.

General strategy then would be:
* `kubeone apply` initiate series of **probes**
* those **probes** advance (or not) state in FSM through state transitions

In the end of process we'd arrive to the FSM state that will dictate next steps
(init cluster? repair cluster? upgrade? leave it alone?).

### Probes
Probes should scan over the SSH available instances for:
* OS/version 
* docker installed
* k8s components installed
* initialized k8s/etcd PKI
* grab nodes from LoadBalancer endpoint
* fetch kubeone config from ConfigMap

Probes trigger FSM events that advance FSM state towards the decision (end
state).

### Reconciliation
Visual representation of reconciliation process, in other words a FSM diagram.

#### Legend
General:
* host/instance — a VM/bare-metal ssh target
* node — initialized k8s node

FSM States:
* idle — initial (entry) state of the FSM
* 0/3 — 0 out of 3 cluster nodes found
* 1/3 — 1 out of 3 cluster nodes found
* 2/3 — 2 out of 3 cluster nodes found
* 3/3 — 3 out of 3 cluster nodes found
* init — "exit" state, which dictates to initialize "cluster init" process
* repair — "exit" state, which dictates to initialize "cluster repair" process
* upgrade — "exit" state, which dictates to initialize "cluster upgrade" process
* error — "exit" state indicating a fatal error
* version check — need to check if nodes versions match the config version
* exit(0) — nothing to do, everything is up2date

FSM Events:
* start_scan — initiate probes
* found_node — indicates that initialized k8s node found
* no_more_hosts — no more hosts to scan left
* host_unreachable — unable to scan provided host
* versions_match_config — indicates that healthy nodes match required
  version
* versions_no_match_config — indicates that some healthy nodes doesn't match
  required version

### Exit state
Depending on end (exit) state of the FSM, proceed with init/repair/upgrade/error logic
path.

### Render shell script
On ether step, generate single shell (individual for every instance) script that
bring node up to the desired state in cluster.
* Generate or copy from leading node PKI
* Install container runtime
* Install kubeadm/kubelet
* Install CNI plugin
* `kubeadm init` / `kubeadm join` / `kubeadm upgrade`

### SSH
Run previously generated scripts over SSH
```bash
sudo sh ./node.sh
```
On every instance that needs it

Last steps:
* kick out dead etcd member if any
* deploy machine-controller
* apply MachineDeployment CR
* deploy other resources (CRDs/Deployments/etc)
* save current kubeone config to ConfigMap in `kube-system`

### Testing
Having Reconciliation FSM + shell generation allow us to unit-test most parts of
the system without interacting with any external API, thus fast and efficient
(E2E is still needed).

Tests will trigger FSM events and see what shell scripts will be generated
and compare them to `golden` files.

## Tasks & effort
The big chunk of what's needed is already done, but used in different form. For
example we already have shell scripts but they're run interactively chunk by
chunk over SSH. Those scripts are translatable to 1 bigger shell script. We also
have experimental branch with PKI generation.

### Steps to implement actions after `init` exit state
* introduce FSM
* figure out and implement **probes** (list in Probes section above)
* integrate to make them work to `init` cluster

### Steps to `repair` end state
Logic path will mostly reuse what we already have for `init` logic path, only
small logic branching would be required to distinguish between what needs to be
changed.

* generate and run shell script for joining instance
* kill dead etcd member

### Steps to `upgrade` end state
Once cluster is completely settled and in healthy condition we can upgrade if we
detect that requested version in config differs from what we actually see (get
nodes, get configmap).

* `kubectl -n kube-system get configmap kubeone`
* compare with provided config
* run upgrade procedures
